## What happened in the Quickstart?

### 1. You setup your local environment

* Pulled down code
* Built project
* Set environment variables

### 2. Started a Server

* `npm start` spins up the HTTP server (`localhost:3000`)

```
HTTP Server (localhost:3000)
            ├── /index.html - frontend code
            └── /auth - endpoint for token generation
```

### 3. Experienced a Token Request Workflow
* User opens browser loads `index.html`.
* `index.html` instructs browser to make a request to `/auth` for a token.
```
Browser → GET /index.html
Browser → Request Token from /auth
```

### 4. Created tokens

* `/auth` uses `@pulsebeam/server` SDK with your environment variables to generate tokens.

```
/auth → @pulsebeam/server SDK → Token → Browser
```

### 5. Started peers

* `index.html` uses `@pulsebeam/peer` SDK with the token to create a peer and communicate with PulseBeam signaling servers.

```
Token → @pulsebeam/peer SDK peer.start() → PulseBeam Signaling Servers
```

### 6. Established a Peer-to-Peer Connection

* Second tab enters `peer-29` in the textbox and clicks `Connect`.
* The second browser initiates a connection to the first browser.
* PulseBeam established a connection.
* Note: `index.html` defines application logic: create data channel and sync text in real time
```
peer → peer.connect('peer-29') → PulseBeam Signaling Servers → connected
```

## Tips 

Logs can be viewed from your console browser inspector.

PulseBeam will work globally within the scope of your project.
* Peers are not limited to two tabs within the same browser.
* You can establish a connection between peers on different networks or machines.

We can't wait to see what you build on PulseBeam! [Connect on Discord](/docs/community-and-support/discord/)!

## Bonus points

Experiment with the demo!

### Explore PulseBeam CLI

Update frontend to work with [PulseBeam CLI](/docs/reference/cli/) instead of `/auth` for token generation.

    One way is to create another input for <code>token</code>, and add a <code>peer.start()</code> button.
