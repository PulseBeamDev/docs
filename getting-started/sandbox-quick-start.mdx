:::note

This quickstart is for setting up with Sandbox. Sandbox is one of PulseBeam's plans. If you are looking to set up with different plan, checkout [this quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quick-start)

* Read [description of Sandbox](/docs/concepts/terms#sandbox). 
* See a list of [our plans](/#pricing). 
* For terms you don't understand, see [our glossary](/docs/concepts/terms).

## What are we going to do?
 
Create **real-time text editor** between two peers. Served locally. This should take less than 5 minutes.

Let's get started.

## 1. Serve it

Letâ€™s set up your local development environment.

You will need `npm` and `node.js` installed on your system. If you don't have them, see <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm" target="_blank">their installation instructions</a>

Run this:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:PulseBeamDev/pulsebeam-js.git
cd pulsebeam-js/demo-cdn
npm i
npm run start
```

You should now have a server running locally on port 3000

## 2. See it

export const groupId =`group-${Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000)}`

* Go to your browser open two tabs:
    * URL for first tab: <a href={`http://localhost:3000/?sandbox=true&peerId=peer-29&groupId=${groupId}`} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">localhost:3000/?sandbox=true&peerId=peer-29&groupId={`${groupId}`}</a>
    * URL for second tab: <a href={`http://localhost:3000/?sandbox=true&groupId=${groupId}`} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">localhost:3000/?sandbox=true&groupId={`${groupId}`}</a>
* On the second tab enter peer-29 in the first text box. Then click connect.
* Type text in the bottom text box in either tab. Changes will synchronize between peers in real-time using WebRTC data channels.

Here's what you should see:

## 3. Sandbox Limitations

:::note

Sandbox is a community-shared auth endpoint. It is also a community-shared PulseBeam project. Therefore, you can have collisions with other users and strange behavior. 

We strongly recommend setting a unique `groupId` in your applications to avoid collisions.

:::

* The Sandbox environment uses a community-shared PulseBeam Cloud auth token endpoint. It is an auth endpoint using @pulsebeam/server SDK.
* PulseBeam connections are globally scoped to a project. 
* Our [other quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quick-start) goes through creating a PulseBeam Account, Project, and Key. Then setting environment variables and running an auth token endpoint locally. Which will guarantee you don't have collisions.
## Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

Youâ€™ve set up a real-time peer-to-peer connection using the PulseBeam Sandbox environment.


## Next steps:


* [Learn: What happened?](/docs/getting-started/what-happened/). 
* Explore the logs
* Experiment with the demo
* Use PulseBeam in your applications ðŸ˜Š

## Troubleshooting
* Check browser console, network tab, make sure your application received a valid auth token. Your request/response should look something like:
    ```json
    {
        "request": {
            "method": "GET",
            "url": "https://cloud.pulsebeam.dev/sandbox/token?groupId=default&peerId=peer-90",
        },
        "response": {
            "status": 200,
            "content": {
                "text": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImtpZCI6ImtpZF9iYzc0ZWE1NWIyZmZlOTdjIn0.eyJleHAiOjE3Mzg0NDA0MDAsImdpZCI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJwaWQiOiJwZWVyLTkwIiwiYXAiOnsiZ3JvdXBfaWQiOiIqIiwicGVlcl9pZCI6IioifX0.KfgjkyZafItYW6TbM0C7BcGCQ6lmpyprA5VnY4GHGuRzQc0f7i8a_7a75-1fOocrQywbSeSNXiTeYCL4glyJDw"
            },
        },
    },
    ```
* The token is the text in the response (example above). You can decode it to inspect further. When you decode it, you should see something like:
    ```json
    {
        "header": {
            "alg": "EdDSA",
            "kid": "kid_bc74ea55b2ffe97c"
        },
        "payload": {
            "exp": 1738440400,
            "gid": "default",
            "pid": "peer-90",
            "ap": {
                "group_id": "*",
                "peer_id": "*"
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    Note: Your decoder may throw an "invalid signature" error when it does not support the algorithm of the token. We use EdDSA, which is fairly new. 
* Port 3000 is already in use (`Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000`) close other process or change port.
* Something odd? Check you node version with `node -v` and `npm -v`. If older than 23.5.0 & 11.0.0 try `nvm use node` or `nvm use 23.5`
* Something else? Checkout logs in browser console or [contact us](/docs/community-and-support/support/)!
