# Introduction

PulseBeam provides a high-level and opinionated real-time media servers that allows you to build video, audio, and even generic real-time data (faster than websocket)
to production as fast as possible with minimal friction. 

We use WebRTC as the underlying transport protocol. Unlike traditional WebRTC deployments, we made concious opinions to reduce complexities, and aim for system stability.

Here is a couple of notable choices (If you have feedback on this, you're very welcome to reach us, we want to hear from you!):

1. SFU only
2. No WebSocket
3. No STUN & TURN servers
4. No WebRTC Port Range
5. H264 and Opus codecs

## SFU Only

There are typically 3 foundational network architectures for WebRTC: 

* P2P: Direct client-to-client. Simple, but bandwidth and number of connections explode with more participants. Not ideal for group calls.
* MCU: Server mixes everyone’s streams. Easier for clients, but adds latency, heavy server load, and reduces flexibility.
* SFU: Server forwards streams without heavy processing. Clients handle rendering, so latency stays low, quality stays high, and it scales well with many participants.

PulseBeam chooses SFU only because it hits the sweet spot: scalable, low-latency, high-quality real-time media, and low CPU.

## No WebSocket

We don't use WebSocket. Instead, we categorize WebRTC signaling as 2 separate categories: 

* Connection: join, leave, reconnect
* Media: media subscription, layout changes, audio level, stream quality

We use HTTP for connection, and data channel for media. The rationale here is to minimize the number of persistent connection from the client to the server.
After the WebRTC connection is established through HTTP, the client has made a persistent bidirectional connection directly to the server, 
might as well use this connection for handling media. 

Aside from reducing devops burden to configure infra properly, data channels allow much higher signaling frequency and lower per-message latency. 
This also means more responsive UI for the end-users.
